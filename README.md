## Keevah

This application provides a hypothetical microlending platform where lenders
can connect with worthwhile projects from around the globe.

##Keevahh -- Micro-lending is a powerful tool for social progress.

###Lending like this is more fun together – it’d be great if lenders could band together into lending groups that make loans together on a weekly or monthly basis.

  * Users register on the site as either a borrower (the business) or a lender (the customer)

  * Borrowers automatically have a borrower page (the store)

  * Within that borrower page, they post one or more loan requests (the products)

  * A loan request has:
    * a title description, categories & photos
    * borrowing amount, requested-by date, a repayments-begin date, and a repayment rate

  * A lender can browse the site and view all open loan requests

  * They can add multiple loans from multiple borrowers to their cart

  * They can then checkout and the funds are allocated to the borrowers

  * The borrowers are notified that funding has come through and their loan request page is updated
