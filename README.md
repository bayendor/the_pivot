#The Pivot

##Learning Goals

###Modeling

Adapt the existing restaurant models to belong to individual businesses
Mind security permissions such that each business does not have any knowledge of other businesses’ data
Push all logic down to the model layer so controllers and views remain simple

###Interface & Views

Use and switch between multiple view templates to reduce view-layer logic
Implement a clean, logical order flow that minimizes customer frustration

###Process

Practice working with a "legacy" codebase to add substantial functionality
Use outside-in TDD/BDD to drive all layers of Rails development
Use a professional project management tool to pace and track progress

##Keevahh -- Micro-lending is a powerful tool for social progress.

###Lending like this is more fun together – it’d be great if lenders could band together into lending groups that make loans together on a weekly or monthly basis.

  * Users register on the site as either a borrower (the business) or a lender (the customer)

  * Borrowers automatically have a borrower page (the store)

  * Within that borrower page, they post one or more loan requests (the products)

  * A loan request has:
    * a title description, categories & photos
    * borrowing amount, requested-by date, a repayments-begin date, and a repayment rate

  * A lender can browse the site and view all open loan requests

  * They can add multiple loans from multiple borrowers to their cart

  * They can then checkout and the funds are allocated to the borrowers

  * The borrowers are notified that funding has come through and their loan request page is updated
